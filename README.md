# Snakes-and-Ladders-React

## Short description:
This is a React-Rails Snakes and Ladders Boardgame! I built it with React-Redux for the front end and Ruby on Rails for the backend.

To refresh your memory on how to play: this game can have multiple players who all take turns rolling a die and the number of die is the number of spaces they move on the board which has 100 squares to land on. When they get to a ladder space, the player game piece is supposed to move up until it reaches the end of that ladder object placed on the board. On the other hand, if they land on a snake, they will move down until they reach the end of that snake object on the board. The first player who gets to 100 spaces officially wins the game.

## Install instructions:
1) Copy and paste the following: git clone git@github.com:codewithirene567/snakes-and-ladders-react.git
2) Type cd snakes-and-ladders-react
3) Type in a command to open the front end file up. Note: If you use Visual Studio Code for your Local Environment type in code .

4) You'll need to get the backend for this project running as well so that the front-end can make fetch requests.
- So the first step is to cd out of the front end.  
- Then type git clone git@github.com:codewithirene567/snakes-and-ladders-backend.git
- Then type cd snakes-and-ladders-backend.
- Type in a command to open the back end file up
- Next run bundle install in the terminal.
- Run rails s
- Copy and paste the link of where the application is running from your terminal into a browser address bar and press enter.

6) Type npm start on the front end
